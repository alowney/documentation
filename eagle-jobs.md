# Eagle Jobs

## Description

HPC dataset with 11M+ jobs from NREL's Eagle supercomputer. These jobs were submitted to run on Eagle between Nov 2018 and Feb 2023. The data are sufficiently anonymized and do not include sensitive user or project data. HPC research community does not have many public, large, and complete job traces like this one, and release of this dataset should help address this gap.  

## Data

This repository contains a single large file: eagle_data.parquet, which uses parquet, a column-oriented data file format with compression.
